# Example scenario

- Suppose you're responsible for deploying and configuring the Azure infrastructure at a toy company. Your company is launching a new toy. You've been asked to deploy a new marketing website in preparation for the launch. The marketing team has also told you that many new toys will be released this year, and it will need a website deployed for each one. You know from past experience that you're not always given much time to get new websites up and running before a toy launches.

- You'll host the website in Azure using Azure App Service. You'll incorporate a storage account for files, such as manuals and specifications, for the toy.
